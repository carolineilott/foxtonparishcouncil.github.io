The following is from Cambridgeshire County Council:

Dear Sir or Madam,

**Station Road, Foxton**

I am writing to advise you that a scheme to **Micro Asphalt** treat the road surface is currently programmed to commence on **Friday 24th April 2015 and is anticipated to last for one day**.

**In order to carry out these works safely and efficiently, it will be necessary to close the road for the duration of the work**. Access will be maintained to properties and premises where safe working operations permit, but delays will be likely. Our contractor onsite will be available to assist where possible, and a signed diversion route will be in place for through traffic (see overleaf).

In order to enable the contractor to complete this work with the minimum of disruption, I would ask you to refrain from parking on the road while the treatment is taking place.

**Micro Asphalt surface treatment is a weather dependent process, and any delays in the program of works are likely to cause changes to the program dates at very short notice**. In order to assist with this, the contractor will carry out their own letter drop shortly before the commencement of works.

I would like to apologise for any disruption that this necessary work may cause, and thank you in advance for your co-operation in this matter.

If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Regards

Martin Gowler
