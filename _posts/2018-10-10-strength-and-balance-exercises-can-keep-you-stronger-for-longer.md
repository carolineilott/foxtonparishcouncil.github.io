**Stay stronger for longer!**

We all want to continue to share our lives with loved ones as we get older, such as playing with grandchildren and socialising with friends. 

Simple strength and balance exercises twice a week are a proven to keep you stronger for longer, independent and enjoying the great things in life, whether by joining a class or doing it yourself at home.

The Stronger for longer campaign has been developed by Cambridgeshire County Council working with local NHS health partners.
