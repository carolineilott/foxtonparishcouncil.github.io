The questionnaire survey recently delivered to every household in Foxton parish generated an encouraging response. 162 completed copies were received by the deadline, with 75% of respondents aged over 45. Special thanks go to Elaine McCarthy for her professional analysis of the completed questionnaires, and her excellent presentation of the main findings in the [attached document](http://www.foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/userfiles/files/Neighbourhood%20Plan%20Questionnaire%20analysis%20-%20April%202017.pdf). The sample is not truly representative of all Foxton residents, as it was a self completion exercise with responses dominated by the older age groups. However, the results do give the Parish Council's Neighbourhood Plan working group a clear steer on the important issues, both now and into the future. 

We are planning to engage with more younger residents over the next few months, to try and ensure we have a broader cross section of views about Foxton moving forward.

The findings, taken together with relevant statistical evidence and policies from other sources, will help the working group decide on the priority objectives and policies for Foxton's emerging Neighbourhood Plan. The Neighbourhood Plan will focus on future land uses in the parish for the next 15 years or so, including housing, community facilities, environment, transport and employment. Some issues raised by respondents are outside the remit of the Neighbourhood Plan process, but having this information will be very helpful to the Parish Council in influencing future decision-making by agencies such as the Highways Department and public transport providers.

Please do read the [summary of results](http://www.foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/userfiles/files/Neighbourhood%20Plan%20Questionnaire%20analysis%20-%20April%202017.pdf), and keep an eye out for future consultations as work on the Neighbourhood Plan progresses.
