**Changes to bin collections this Christmas and New Year**

South Cambridgeshire and Cambridge residents are being asked to double-check their bin collection dates during the Christmas and New Year period â€“ and recycle as much as possible during the festivities.

Many regular collection days will be changing due to the bank holidays. The collection for Christmas Day, Tuesday 25 December, has been brought forward to Saturday 22 December.
