The scheme offers the following benefits to landlords:

* a guaranteed monthly rent in advance for the term of the lease (3 years);

* no management fees;

* day-to-day maintenance;

* regular property inspections;

* 'hassle-free' full management service.

They have a full page article in the latest version of the South Cambs Magazine, which is due out shortly.
