New Online Toolkit for Tackling Social Isolation and Loneliness

A new toolkit aimed at individuals and groups concerned about loneliness was published on the Council website this week.  The toolkit includes case studies of a range of successful local projects plus advice, guidance and signposting to local sources of help and funding for setting up new projects. 

The toolkit is at [http://www.scambs.gov.uk/community/toolkit-for-tackling-social-isolation-and-loneliness/](http://www.scambs.gov.uk/community/toolkit-for-tackling-social-isolation-and-loneliness/) .

For more information, or to suggest a project to be added to the case studies, please contact Siobhan Mellon [siobhan.mellon@scambs.gov.uk](mailto:siobhan.mellon@scambs.gov.uk)
