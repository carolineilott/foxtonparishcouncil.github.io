**New December Timetable**

From December 10th, the weekday timetable will revert to the intended May timetable.  Details can be found on the [Great Northern website](https://www.greatnorthernrail.com/travel-information/plan-your-journey/timetables) and a PDF of the new timetable can be downloaded from the Rail User Group [website](http://meldrethsheprethfoxtonrail.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GTR1812PTT13.pdf). An extract here shows the additional trains in yellow.
