Due to the hard work of a Foxton resident, the new green cabinet that was installed opposite the village shop a few months ago, has now gone live. This means that the residents of Chardle Field and Chalk Hill, which were constructed after Virgin laid their cables throughout Foxton, can now access Superfast Fibre Broadband increasing Broadband speeds of 1-2Mbps to somewhere between 35 and 52 Mbps - a truly significant improvement. In addition the other 280 addresses within the blue line on the map, can now benefit from having the choice of many other service providers in addition to Virgin and BT.

This installation was done at no cost to the community due to the Foxton resident submitting a Community Fibre Partnership application. The costs were met by Open Reach, BT and Broadband UK.
