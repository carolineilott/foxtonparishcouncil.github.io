From Sunday 29th July 2018 the No. 26 bus service will be replaced by an extension to Busway A, operating hourly between Royston and Trumpington Park & Ride before continuing to St Ives.  

Barrington and Haslingfield will no longer be served in the morning or evening by the replacement service. The replacement service will operate between Trumpington P&R and Cambridge city centre via the busway so will not serve Trumpington High Street or Trumpington Road during morning and evening peak times. An alternative service will be provided by the Park & Ride bus at limited bus stops.
