**Innovate and Cultivate community fund applications**
Care Network are working with Cambridgeshire County Council Strengthening Communities to support local people to set up Good Neighbour Schemes through the ‘Cultivate’ Fund.

The next deadline for applications is 1st November and following that 1 February 2020 so if you are bursting with an idea for your community and could do with a bit of help to get it off the ground, please get in touch.

Pre-application advice sessions are held for each funding round. The next session will be held on Thursday 19 September 2019 between 9.30am and 12.30pm at Ely Community Centre. Free places can be booked here [https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/innovate-cultivate-fund-advi…](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/innovate-cultivate-fund-advice-session-19-september-2019-tickets-65794490091?fbclid=IwAR2hd0q9RgTxTVq2wP5D4Kqi1mhNUu0oDVLl2HbLYBq-bk7KUjYDScIefTs).
