**<p style="text-align: center;">Reporting non-emergencies online</p>**

Non-emergency situations can now be reported to the police online if people would rather do so than call 101.

In October last year Cambridgeshire Constabulary re-launched their website with added functionality to report non-emergencies via specially designed forms or a live webchat.

The live webchat option enables people to communicate directly with a member of staff in the control room, just as would be the case when calling 101. Online forms are processed in the same way as a call and the person reporting can expect a response within 24 hours.

Due to the high level of demand there are often queues when calling 101. Reporting online is quick, easy and free of charge.

Superintendent James Sutherland said: “In the digital age people are doing more and more online. I’m pleased that our website now has increased capability to allow people to contact us in this way.

 | “The system went through a thorough testing process and has been used successfully thousands of times since being introduced.

“Feedback from a recent survey suggested that some people wanted to communicate directly with a person rather than submitting an online form. The webchat function allows people to do exactly that.

“Reports submitted online are treated in the same way as when people call 101 and will receive the same outcome.”

To view the online reporting section of the constabulary’s website visit www.cambs.police.uk/report/. The live webchat function is available by clicking on the green icon on the bottom right of the page.
