Carriageway patching works, in advance of micro asphalt surface treatment later this year, are programmed to take place on Station Road, commencing on Monday 9th March, and are anticipated to last one day. This work will be done by Cambridgeshire Highways, on behalf of Cambridgeshire County Council.

In order to ensure safe and efficient working, it will be necessary to close the road to through traffic during operational hours, approximately 8am â€“ 4pm. Access will be permitted to properties and businesses within the closure when it is considered safe to do so, and you are asked not to park on the road.  Please liaise with the contractor onsite for directions and advice, and kindly follow any instructions provided.

A signed diversion route will be in place (see [here](http://foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/userfiles/files/Closure%20of%20Station%20Road%2C%20March%202015.pdf) for details) .

Whilst the contractor, Cambridgeshire Highways, will try to keep delays to a minimum; delays are to be expected and extra time should be allowed for journeys.  The County Council apologise for any inconvenience caused by these works, and thank you for your co-operation and understanding.  If you require any further information, please contact Martin Gowler, Local Infrastructure and Street Management, Cambridgeshire County Council on 0345 045 5212 or [martin.gowler@cambridgeshire.gov.uk](mailto:martin.gowler@cambridgeshire.gov.uk).
