Joan Burns is retiring as our Parish Clerk at the end of March 2015, after 21 years of service.

March's Parish Council meeting was Joan's last meeting as our clerk. After the meeting, she was presented with a bunch of flowers and a cut glass bowl engraved with a message of thanks for her 21 years of service to the Parish Council.
