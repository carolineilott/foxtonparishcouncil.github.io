South Cambs Police hold panel meetings for each Sector every quarter, residents and business owners are encouraged to attend and share their crime and disorder concerns, thereby influencing local policing priorities for the next four months. Anyone can attend the meetings. 

The next South Cambs Police panel meetings are to be held as follows:-

**Sawston Sector – Tuesday 18th October 2016 between 7.30 pm and 9.00 pm at Sawston Village College**
