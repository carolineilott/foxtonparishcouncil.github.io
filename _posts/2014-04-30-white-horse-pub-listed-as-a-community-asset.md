The "Community Right to Bid" is a new initiative introduced in the Localism Act of 2011. It allows communities and parish councils to nominate buildings or land for listing by the local authority as an asset of community value.

An asset can be listed if its principal use furthers the communityâ€™s social well-being or social interests (including cultural, sporting or recreational interests) and is likely to do so in the future. It means that if a listed asset comes to be sold, a moratorium on the sale (of up to six months) may be invoked, providing local community groups with the chance to raise finance, develop a business plan and to make a bid to buy the asset on the open market.

The White Horse in Foxton has now been registered as a community asset under this scheme. For more details see the [South Cambridgeshire District Council](https://www.scambs.gov.uk/community-right-bid) web site.
