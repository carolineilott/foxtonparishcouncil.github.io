Foxton Parish Council plays an active part in all local planning issues. It is probably the area of the Council's role that is best known to the community and which can be of the most importance.

The Parish Council is notified (by South Cambridgeshire District Council) of all planning applications for the area. These are publicised and discussed at public meetings by the planning committee or the full Parish Council. Comments are returned to the District Council, and may be accompanied by a Parish Council recommendation for the application to be approved or refused. Although this recommendation does not have to be adhered to by the District Council, the Parish Council's comments must be taken into account when a decision is made.

The Planning committee is also currently considering an extension of the conservation area in Foxton, and looking to produce a [Neighbourhood Plan](http://www.foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/page.php?id=287).

For a list of current planning applications please see the [Planning Applications](http://foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/planning.php) page.

The planning committee can be contected by e-mail ([planning@foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk](mailto:planning@foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk)) or via the parish clerk (see the '[Contact Us](http://www.foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/contact.php?id=13)' page)
