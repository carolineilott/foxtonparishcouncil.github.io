__Communities urged to have their say on Cambridge-Oxford rail link__

Foxton Parish Council have responded to the East West Rail current proposals for the rail route from Bedford to Cambridge. The Parish Council supports the 2 northern routes over the 3 southern routes but is in favour of the CamBedRailRoad proposal, details of which can be found at http://www.cambedrailroad.org/.

The response of the Meldreth, Shepreth and Foxton Community Rail Partnership and Rail User Group can be seen [here](http://bit.ly/MSFCRPEWR).

Foxton Parish Council's response can be seen [here](http://www.foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/userfiles/files/EWR%20-%20Feedback%20Form%20on%20March%20Consultation.pdf).

This is not a statutory consultation and there will be much more information in the coming months, but it is important that Foxton gets its view across at the start.

Some of the 5 proposed routes for a new Bedford to Cambridge railway line across South Cambridgeshire include Foxton within their hatched areas of search or lie very close to it.

Route options A,C, D can be found [here](http://www.foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/userfiles/files/Options-ACD%5C%27.pdf).

Route options B, E can be found [here](http://www.foxtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/userfiles/files/Options-BE%2BCBRRw%281%29.pdf).

CamBedRailRoad (CBRR) believe that none of the five proposed Route Options are suitable and have put forward an alternative proposal for a northern route that would serve planned new developments and areas of population growth and join the existing network north of Cambridge.

Click [here](http://www.cambedrailroad.org/fluidcms/files/files/Northern-Approach-Into-Cambridge2.pdf) to view their arguments for a northern approach.
